# Coursera-skills-and-rank
A Jupyter notebook analysis on the Coursera skills and rank across different regions
This repo contains 18 files which are combined together into two sections
1. Section 1 : Coursera skills of different regions (Asia, africa, eupore etc)
2. Section 2 : Coursera ranks of different subject variety from all regions as well.

Both the sections are then analyzed and visualized without interpretation as the graphs speaks for itself.
note: It also has some EDA but without pivot table as we did not have enough categorical variables
